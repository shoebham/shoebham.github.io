Welcome fellow human, to my website.
It might look like there isn't much here, there isn't.

You can figure out how to navigate this website yourself.

This websites design was taken from <a href="https://emile.space">emile.space</a>(a site I came across and really liked) and modified to fit my needs, although content in my website is very less. I hope to add more content in the future.
