# Random thoughts

I haven't written anything in a long time, this might be a good place to pen down my thoughts, since it's public It will motivate me to write clear and concise thoughts.


I have been thinking of making my own website since a long time, but I was lazy. One fine evening while casusally surfing the internet, I came across a beautful website <a href="https://emile.space/">emile.space</a>. 
It looked beatiful to me.
I knew I wanted a website like this. So I dug deep and found the source code for the website (open source ftw!!) and the static site generator emile created and used it to create my own website (though this site is very empty compared to the original). I am very happy with the result. I hope to add more content in the future.
Also I love discovering random cool sites like this.

I promised myself that before new year I will deploy my own website. It's 29th December and I haven't fulfilled that promise yet, but I am close. I am writing this post to remind myself to finish this task before new year.
