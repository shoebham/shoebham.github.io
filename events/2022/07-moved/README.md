# Shifted

Left my hometown and moved to mumbai for college. 
Leaving my hometown was a big deal for me, because I have lived here for 22 years of my life, there were so many things I was leaving behind my family, friends, memories. Uncertainity clouded my head if i'll ever come back here permanently. 

I was kinda excited for the new experiences.

Nostalgia hits hard sometimes.
