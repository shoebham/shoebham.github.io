        # Excalidraw in New Tab extension
        
        I got bored looking at the usual new tab screen and wanted it to be a space where I can actually see things I want to see like my pending tasks.

        So I generated this extension with claude sonnet. I didn't write a single piece of code for this. Works pretty well. Amazing!

        - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
        - Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing your extension files.

        # Terms & Conditions Summarizer
        
        After reading the recent news Disney where a man couldn't go to court because he bought Disney+.
        I made an extension with assistance from cursor (or cursor created this extension with my assistance) to summarise t&c of the website you're visiting.
