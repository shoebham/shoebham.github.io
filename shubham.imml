        Some of my completed projects are
        
        | name | tech | info |
        | ---- | ---- | ---- |
        | [text to isl](https://github.com/shoebham/text_to_isl) | `python` `nlp` `javascript` | converts text to sign language through animation. <sub>this project recieves a lot of attention from college students.|
        | [bRAG-ollama](https://github.com/shoebham/bRAG-ollama) | `python` `LLM` | made this just to explore RAG and LLMs without any framework like langchain |
        | [fact check search](https://github.com/shoebham/Fact_check_Search) | `android` `java` | my very first project that got me my first internship |

        # Excalidraw in New Tab extension
        
        I got bored looking at the usual new tab screen and wanted it to be a space where I can actually see things I want to see like my pending tasks.

        So I generated this extension with claude sonnet. I didn't write a single piece of code for this. Works pretty well. Amazing!


        if you want to use it locally, just 
        - Clone this 
        - Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
        - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
        - Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing your extension files.
